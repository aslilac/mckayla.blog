<aside>This series of blog posts targets developers who are already proficient in at least one
other programming language. Instead of covering basics, I intend to cover the most common
“Rust-isms” that people tell me are keeping them from learning the language.</aside>

- Lifetimes, and why you shouldn’t care about them
- Why does Rust have so many string types? (and how to cope)
- “The Borrow Checker”
- Borrowing, lifetimes, and async Rust
- References are `Copy`
- `Arc`, `Rc`, and `Box`
- `Ref`, `RefMut`, and `RefCell`
- Rust’s macros are cooler than yours
- Async vs multithreading, and async runtimes (Send + Sync)
- Auto-traits (like Sized)
- Wine and fine `dyn`ing
- Build your own `Iterator` trait
