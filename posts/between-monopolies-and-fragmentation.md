title: Between monopolies and fragmentation, the consumer always loses.

Technology is complicated. You may be reading this on a smart phone, tablet, laptop,
desktop computer, some crazy smart watch, a pair of future-glasses™️ or whatever other
thing. The general structure of that device is largely the same though: really, really
complicated. It has some form of HTML renderer (which I believe would be the same for the
Android and iOS apps as well, but it doesn't really matter) which communicates with the
server using the HTTP protocol over a TCP socket which is established using the Internet
Protocol or IP. We're just getting started though! This is all running on top of an
operating system which includes display drivers, input drivers, a scheduler, a file
system, and countless other things I could name. That operating system runs on a processor
with thousands of transistors that communicates with memory which also contains thousands
of transistors and likely some form of solid state drive which also contains thousands or
millions or billions of transistors. My main point is that you reading this article is the
culmination of the work of millions of people over several decades.

This level of complication makes things challenging: imagine a world where instead of
building on top of each advancement as they came we built the same thing in five slightly
different ways, and then built the next evolution on top of those five slightly different
ways and built on top of each of them in five slightly different ways. It would quickly
result in chaos, a lack of innovation, and the overall unhappiness of the people who work
to move technology forward.

There has been a lot of talk lately about breaking up big tech, and I have some very mixed
feelings about it. There are some companies I would like to see broken up that have gotten
too large, but there are other companies that face restrictions and division that I fear
might limit their ability to innovate. Some of these restrictions may even serve only to
frustrate companies and consumers with no clear benefit to anyone.
